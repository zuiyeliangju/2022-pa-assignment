## Part 1-Google Experiment

## Topic:Surveying Employees for Salary Raise vs. Bonus Preference

## To find out the preference of employees between salary raise and bonus, Google’s People Analytics group ran a survey asked employees to choose the best among many competing pay options. And the finding was that employees valued the base pay the most. Accordingly, Googlers’ overall raise was done by a 10% base salary increase which had been a sucess in terms of being more compeitive on keeping employees.

## About the survey itself been used to find out the preference, by using Shufflebeam et al. article notation, it should be:

## NR: Non-Random experiment, since there is no control group.

## O1: Observation in this experiment is the attrition of competing companies. O1 is the attrition of compeitng companies is “increasing”.

## x: The change in this experiement is raise 10% base salary.

## O2: O2 is the attrition of compeitng companies is “reducing”.

## Although this experiment had been a sucess, it could be a more convincing experiement.Since there is no group with bouns raise, the sucess could possible only from the raise itself. We cannot get conclusion that salary raise is better than bonus raise. The desinger could include a control group with bonus increasingl only so that Google could compare the observations from salary raise and bonus raise.

## Part 2: Manager’s Motivation Tactics

## By reviewing the data before and after performing different motivation tactics (A or B), my observation include:

\#1. In terms of the average individual performance, tactic B performs
better; \#2. In terms of overall team performane, tactic B helps
perfomance to improve but not very obvsious, while tactic A makes the
overall performance much worse. And by checking closely the individuals
who perform worse under A, it is surprisly to notice that most
individuals have the best performce before applying tactic A； \#3. In
terms of number of individuals performing better, both tactic A and B
help improve slightly more than half of total individuals. The
difference is about 2%.

## My conclusion is that tactic B helps improve the employee performance while A harms performance.

## Expert says tactic A helps employee performance and tactic B harms employee performance. I think Expert could be right if the performce evaluation criteria do not reflect the real performance. Or the obvervation of performance is only short term obvervation and the worse or better performance under A and B are temporary. Performance under tactic A will get better in long-term run while performce under tactic B will get worse.
